<h1>Why Blog?</h1><p>Hello, I am OrcThinker and I've wanted to create an article that will share with readers who exactly am I and why this website exists in the first place.</p><h2> Who am I?</h2><p>I am another programmer that doesn't really know what he is doing. I am working commercially as a fullstack developer with a focus on C# backend since 2021. I've started programming 4 years before starting as a junior dev and have managed to get a Bachelor's degree in computer science with specialization in web apps.</p><p>The more I work the more I find myself lacking in skills when it comes to software development. I've always tought that if I play my cards correctly I'll be able to gain knowledge some unkown to me areas. Unfortunetly I was wrong and I found out that if I really want to learn something I'll have to do it in my own time and of my own volition. So to not build for the N'th time same things for a web app I'll built something on my own.</p><h2> Why this blog?</h2><p>TLDR: I like to write, want to check if explaining things will help me understand them and maybe have someone see my work</p><p>There are many reasons why I created this website, so I'll seperate them into 5 chapters.</p><h2> 1. Publicity</h2><p>"Create insetead of consuming" are the words that made me have a moment of realization. I am watching others lives, admiring strangers instead of living and telling my own story. I want to have something, somewhere where I can create and share whatever I'd like.</p><h2> 2. Proof</h2><p>I want to have a history of things I have done to have a proof that I am trying but also to be able to come back few months later and see what shitty code I wrote. I am who I am and I know what I know. Those things will change but one thing I don't want to change is the fact that I keep on working on myself everyday.</p><h2> 3. Writing</h2><p>I really do enjoy writing. I don't understand it, maybe I am a little weird but even if I have to write boring code I simply enjoy the process of writing itself. I do hope to improve my writing skills and have some fun whilst doing it.</p><h2> 4. Knowledge</h2><p>The problem is that there haven't been challange that would completely stomp me at my job yet when listening to people online, to some of my friends I tend to feel dumb and lacking.</p><p>From the other perspective I hate the thing which someone called "web plumbing". There are many situations where I am simply using frameworks that do all the heavy lifting and keep thinking "How does this thing work and could I write my own thing". Here I hope to explore those topics.</p><p>I want to at least try the following: Http server, 2d and 3d games, database and git.</p><h2> 5. Coincidance</h2><p>This blog was created by pure coincidance. I was just checking out odin lang.</p><ul><li><a href=" https://odin-lang.org/"> https://odin-lang.org/</a></li></ul><p>And have been reminded about github pages whilst looking for a small project I could write in odin. So instantly idea was created. I'll write program that will automatically render me a github pages project based on .org files (I do love me some writing in .org files). So this page as all the others have been automatically generated by my odin github pages generator.</p><ul><li><a href=" https://github.com/OrcThinker/OrcPagesGenerator"> https://github.com/OrcThinker/OrcPagesGenerator</a></li></ul><h2> Summary</h2><p>I am not the brightest dev but I sure do hope to become one. I write this blog mostly to become better and to have some fun. If anyone ever gets anything out of it that would be a great bonus and for sure make my day better.</p>

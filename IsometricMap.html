<h1>Isometric Map</h1><p>In this article we are going to go over what is isometric perspective, why do we love it and how to implement it using odin lang. We are going to go over rendering textures, selecting tiles with mouse, adding new ones, deleting existing  and a bit more.</p><h2> Isometric perspective - what is it?</h2><p>Here goes what it is, we love it cuz some games.</p><p>We are going to use odin with rl cuz odin is cool</p><h2> Rendering first tile</h2><p>How a tile looks. Creating tile in paint. Its size + height. Math behind it. Adding more "tiles" so that we may create some custom looks for the "map"</p><p>Now let's try to render more tiles with for loop</p><p>Let's have some text to help us see what is happening in the app</p><h2> Mouse collision detection - my way</h2><p>This is kinda done by my own idea. I've implemented something similar in past however I wanted to try writing it by my own hand</p><p>2 parts:</p><p>1st we need to have some sort of to detect hover over: 2 tiles + rectangle compose perfectly the tiles hitbox</p><p>2nd upper tile = TOP, rest split in 2 gives LEFT and RIGHT</p><h2> Z-sorting</h2><p>How to sort in isometric view</p><p>Z is closest to the screen and will always be on top of somthing</p><p>X and Y both contribute the same to the distance between tile and camera</p><h2> Adding and Deleting tiles</h2><p>Let's add tiles and have a way to add different tiles</p><p>keyboard presses for modes we will need</p><p>How to add and delete and what it entails</p><h2> Continuation: level render mode / editing tiles</h2><p>How and why render mode</p><h2> Epliogue</h2><p>What can be done now, links that have helped me and closing words</p>
